# To-do cards

Hi there!

The todo  project focuses on creating, displaying, updating and deleting tasks to do. Besides the chance to filter them and display them based on status, priority and  dateline. 


I used React and Redux for frontend. Moreover as a developer always looking to improve the code quality, I have integrated TypeScript and ESLint (Prettier)as well.

##Demo

- [Develop](https://deploy-preview-13--todo-jelou.netlify.app/)

## Roles
- Administrador

## Features
- Sing up form: To access the dashboard is necessary fill out the form and submit the information.
- It's mandatory use those given credentials: 
-- {
    "email": "eve.holt@reqres.in",
    "password": "pistol"
-- }

- Sing in: Once you are registered correctly, go to login and fill out the form, next press login button
- It's mandatory use those given credentials: 

-- "email": "eve.holt@reqres.in",

-- Display tasks: Once you are logged in the web you will be able to see a list fo tasks. Besides you then are able  to filter tasks by search query, status, priority and  dateline.

-- Edit task: Every card has a button to open a modal with the purpose to edit current info.

# To-do cards

Hi there!

The todo  project focuses on creating, displaying, updating and deleting tasks to do. Besides the chance to filter them and display them based on status, priority and  dateline. 


I used React and Redux for frontend. Moreover as a developer always looking to improve the code quality, I have integrated TypeScript and ESLint (Prettier)as well.
